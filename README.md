# Happiness Project

Use the python API praw to say nice things about people's projects in:
* /r/RASPBERRY_PI_PROJECTS

## To Add:
* /r/somethingimade
* /r/DIY/
* /r/diyelectronics/
* /r/totallynotrobots/

## Improvements:
1. Look for question marks in the title and the text body.
2. Toggle between different subreddits.
3. In DIY and somethingimade: Only comment on posts that have less than 1 comment.
4. Try adding new robots for scale.
5. Add an upvote!
6. Save the comment ID in another file for using it later.
7. Create a readme that shows our work: all the threads replied to!
